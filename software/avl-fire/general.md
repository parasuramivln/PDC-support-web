# How to use AVL/Fire on PDC machines
AVL/Fire is commercial software and the users must provide their own license to the software.
And the AVL license environment variable should be specified in **~/.flexlmrc** e.g. 
```
AVL_LICENSE_FILE=31411@<license_server>.kth.se
```
To see which versions of AVL/Fire are installed on any of the machines at PDC log into the machine and type 
```
module avail fire
```
More details about the software, see

## How to use

On Lindgren to use Fire then cluster compatability mode (CCM) must be used. Note your account must be specially enabled to use CCM on Lindgren. Contact support@pdc.kth.se if you need your account to be able to use CCM.

# Running interactively on Lindgren
It is not possible to use the interactive nodes to run CCM jobs. However it is possible to reserve some nodes in CCM mode and use them interactively. To do this use. If no nodes are available you will join the batch queue until they become available.
qsub -q ccm -I -l mppwidth=48 -l walltime=30:00
then fire can be started using
module load ccm avl
nodes=`hostconvert_fire.pl $PBS_NODEFILE`
ccmrun run_fire.sh $PBS_O_WORKDIR 48 $nodes CaseName
The default *run_fire.sh* is shown below. If you need different flags for *cfdwm_solver* then a new run_fire.sh script can be made and used instead.
Also the command
ccmlogin
can be used to login to the head node of the ccm allocation, at which point it is possible to call *cfdwm_solver* directly. The enviroment variable *$PBS_NODEFILE* is not exported in this case though, so the nodes must be set carefully.

## Running in batch mode on Lindgren
To run in batch mode it similar to running a normal job, except the special CCM queue must be used. With CCM it is necessary to use two scripts. A PBS job script and the script that gets started by CCM on the reserved nodes.
Example PBS script
and the **run_fire.sh** script (make the file executable!) looks likes
