# The Intel Compiler
Intel provides a c, c++ and fortran compiler which is installed
on many systems at PDC.


## How to use

When compiling on Beskow the cc/CC/ftn wrappers should always be
used. Which compiler is used is determined by which PrgEnv module is
loaded. e.g. to use the intel compiler PrgEnv-intel needs to be loaded
e.g. by doing
```
module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-intel
```
To use the intel compiler icc, icpc or ifortran should not be called
directly, but the wrappers used instead, e.g. 
```
cc hello.c
```
It is then possible to see which version of the intel compiler is loaded using
```
cc --version
```
The versions available can be seen using 
```
module avail intel
```
The version required can then be loaded using for example 
```
module swap intel/14.0.4.211 intel/15.0.1.133

```
