# CFD General Notation System (CGNS)
Provides a general, portable, and extensible
standard for the storage and retrieval of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis data.
It consists of a collection of conventions, and free and open software implementing those conventions.
It is self-descriptive, machine-independent, well-documented, and administered by an international steering committee.
It is also an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Recommended Practice.
