# Using Intel MPI at PDC
`Intel MPI <https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mpi-library>`_ is a commercial MPI product from Intel.
To see which versions of Intel MPI are available use
```
module avail intelmpi
```

## How to use


# Compiling your program using Intel MPI
Intel MPI has two mpicc/mpif90 type wrapper scripts for automatically
linking the required MPI libraries and header files.

## Using Intel compiler
To use the intel compiler with Intel MPI you must have one of the
i-compiler modules and the intel mpi moudule loaded
```
module load i-compilers/15.0.2 intelmpi/5.0.3
```
Then you can use
```
mpiifort  (FORTRAN)
mpiicc    (C)
mpiicpc   (C++)
```
to compile and link your MPI programs.

## Using gcc
Intel MPI also has wrappers that automatically use gcc
```
FORTRAN: mpifc, mpif90, mpif77
C:       mpicc
C++:     mpicxx
```
If the compiler is invoked using these commands then the version of
gcc or gfortran in your $PATH is automatically used to compile Other
wrappers
As well as the compiler specific wrappers you can also use
```
mpifc  -fc=<compiler>
mpif90 -fc=<compiler>
mpif77 -fc=<compiler>
```
mpicc  -cc=<compiler>
mpicxx -cxx=<compiler>
Note the PGI compiler is not supported

## Running Intel MPI programs using SLURM
IntelMPI has slurm support so it is not necessary to make machinefiles
as it can take the required information from the environment variables set
by SLURM
e.g. running interactively
```
salloc --nodes=2 --ntasks-per-node=24
mpirun -np 48 ./program.x
```
similarly using a job script
