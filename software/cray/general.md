# The Cray Compiler
Cray provides a c, c++ and fortran compiler which is installed
on the Cray systems at PDC.


## How to use

When compiling on Beskow the cc/CC/ftn wrappers should always be
used. Which compiler is used is determined by which PrgEnv module is
loaded. e.g. to use the cray compiler PrgEnv-cray needs to be loaded, this is the default.
To use the cray compiler the cc/CC/ftn wrappers used, e.g. 
```
cc hello.c
```
It is then possible to see which version of the cray compiler is loaded using
```
cc -V
```
The versions available can be seen using 
```
module avail cce
```
The version required can then be loaded using for example 
```
module swap cce/8.3.4 cce/8.3.5

```
