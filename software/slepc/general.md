SLPEc the *Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations*
SLEPc is a software library for the solution of large scale sparse eigenvalue problems on parallel computers.
It is an extension of PETSc and can be used for linear eigenvalue problems in either standard or generalized form, with real or complex arithmetic.
It can also be used for computing a partial SVD of a large, sparse, rectangular matrix, and to solve nonlinear eigenvalue problems (polynomial or general). Additionally, SLEPc provides solvers for the computation of the action of a matrix function on a vector.

## How to use

The Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations (SLEPc) closely integrate with the optimized PETSc builds provided by Cray.
Cray Programming Environment is assumed.
In order to use slepc
