Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for Linux, OS/2, MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms.
It was originally created to allow scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions and data interactively,
but has grown to support many non-interactive uses such as web scripting.
It is also used as a plotting engine by third-party applications like Octave.
